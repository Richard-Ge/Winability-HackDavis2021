# HackDavis-2021

We have no idea what we're doing. Please help us.

To test the Django webpage: 
0. (download the entire `website-outer` folder)
1. navigate to the inside of the outer folder (so `manage.py` shows after "ls")
2. run `manage.py` with the launch option `runserver` (for my macbook, it's `website-outer % python3 manage.py runserver`)
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/displaytable/ in your browser (it's only a development server, but it still works as intended)
