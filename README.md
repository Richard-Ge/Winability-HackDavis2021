# HackDavis-2021

This website is meant to show you which stocks are good long-term investments through their Price-Expenditure Ratios (PE Ratios) and normal distributions. 

To test the Django webpage: 

1. Download the entire `HackDavis-2021` folder
2. After extracting the folder, navigate to /HackDavis-2021/website-outer/ (so `manage.py` shows after "ls")
3. Enter the command `python3 manage.py runserver` (i.e. run the manage.py python file with the word `runserver` after it (as a command line argument))
4. Once you see the text [here](https://i.imgur.com/0iwPjXl.png), go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/displaytable/ in your browser (it's running on a development server, but it still works as intended)
5. You should be able to see the top <n/2> stocks, of the <n> stocks we included in the program.
