# Winability

Winability is a web application designed towards new investors who may be swayed speculation and hype around a certain stock. A user can search for a stock and the website will display the stock's price and win/loss percentage. We hope this can act as a tool to help investors not fall into investments beyond their risk tolerance.

To test the Django webpage: 

1. Download the entire `HackDavis-2021` folder
2. After extracting the folder, navigate to /HackDavis-2021/website-outer/ (so `manage.py` shows after "ls")
3. Enter the command `python3 manage.py runserver` (i.e. run the manage.py python file with the word `runserver` after it (as a command line argument))
4. Once you see the text [here](https://i.imgur.com/0iwPjXl.png) (specifically the "Quit the server with Control-C" at the bottom), go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/displaytable/ in your browser (it's running on a development server, but it still works as intended)
5. You should be able to see the top <n/2> stocks, of the <n> stocks we included in the program.
